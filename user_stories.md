As regular User I can:\
    - register account via website;\
    - ask for remove account;\
    - login into my account via website;\
    - create repository for texts;\
    - add note;\
    - remove note;\
    - see my notes;\
    - modify chosen note;\
    - see history of chosen note (modifications, various versions);\
    - remove repository.

As Admin I have all the options of an ordinary user and in addition:\
    - can see list of users & basic info about repositories (eg. size);\
    - suspend User's account (so account isn't removed, but User can't login on it);\
    - remove User's account;\
    - remove User's repository.
